# Chess Engine in Python

This is a chess engine built in Python that allows human players to play against a computer opponent. The engine consists of four files:

- `engine_drivers.py`: contains methods to validate, make, and undo moves on the board.
- `core_engine.py`: contains the algorithms used to build the computer opponent to play the game against human players.
- `main.py`: initiates the game by running a Pygame instance.
- `move.py`: defines the move class.

## Features

The engine has the following features:

- A simple, user-friendly interface that allows human players to easily make their moves.
- A powerful computer opponent that uses advanced algorithms to make its moves.
- Support for saving and loading games, so that players can resume their games later.
- Support for undoing moves, in case a player makes a mistake.
- Support for specifying the level of difficulty of the computer opponent, so that players can adjust the challenge as they improve.

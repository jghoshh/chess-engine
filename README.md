# Chess Engine in Python

This is a chess engine built in Python that allows human players to play against a computer opponent. The engine consists of four files:

- `engine_drivers.py`:  This file includes functions that validate, make, and undo moves on the chessboard.
- `core_engine.py`: The core engine file comprises the algorithms used to build the computer opponent to play against human players.
- `main.py`: This file starts the game by running a Pygame instance.
- `move.py`: The move class is defined in this file and is used to store the state of moves in the game.
- `castle_check.py`: The castle class is defined in this file and is used to store the state of castles in the game.
